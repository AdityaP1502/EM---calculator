# EM---calculator
Calcualtor for solving EM equations and problems.

## Supported Calculation
You can use this calculator to calculate problem given below:
1. Transmited and reflected wave perpendicular to surface for multiple interface
2. Transmited and reflected wave at any angle. Only for two medium
<br></br>
__Notes__: For detailed explaination on implemented calculation and mode, refer to docs.

# Installation
To install, just clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/AdityaP1502/EM---calculator
```
__No extra packages are needed__
# Run
to run the program, go to EM--calculator dir and run
```
python start.py
```
__Notes__ : Tested on python 3.10.2. It seemed there are error on type alias when using python 3.8.10. So probably won't work for any older version too. 
# Further Works
1. Complete the documentation
2. Support for incidince angle greater than critical angle (mode 3)
